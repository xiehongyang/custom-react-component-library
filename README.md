# AntD-Styled Component Library
This repository aims to develop a component library that mirrors the functionalities of Ant Design (AntD) using TypeScript and React. Throughout this process, it integrates a series of crucial knowledge points, including:

* Organizing styles in a large-scale project
* Testing React components
* Implementing React animations
* Upon completion, the development also encompasses modular packaging, code release procedures, and the full workflow of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).
